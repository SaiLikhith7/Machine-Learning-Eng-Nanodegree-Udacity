### Requires Changes 2 SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRE CHANGES

Hi,

It‚Äôs a pleasure to review your project, this is a very good submission and cool project.

Just a few more details and you are done here.

Keep up the good work üôå and count on us!

Best regards,



### Definition 

*Student provides a high-level overview of the project in layman‚Äôs terms. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is given.*

Good work here with the first section. Very interesting topic of your choice.

It's easy to understand the project as a whole, with a good focus on the practical importance of a good solution.

It's clear how machine learning is a viable solution in this situation, based on your discussion here.

Project domain, origin, data sets and inputs are given and well explained. Congrats!!!

<br>

*The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.*

Good introduction and description of the problem you are trying to solve here.

Your objective and expected results are clear here.

Also, the strategy is discussed.

Well done!

<br>

*Metrics used to measure the performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem.*

Please review this part.

- Write the equation of the metric that you are using.

The Sklearn API Reference for metrics is a great reference and also source of learning. I really like it! Take a look: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html

- Also, explain why did you choose this metric? What makes it a good candidate.

<br>

### Analysis 

*If a dataset is present, features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed, along with a sampling of the data. In lieu of a dataset, a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics of the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified.*

Very nice job describing your dataset.

<br>

*A visualization has been provided that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data with thorough discussion. Visual cues are clearly defined.*

Good discussion here overall.

**REQUIRED**

Please explain why are you using these algorithms. What makes these good candidates to solve the problem?

In this section, you should focus on describing how your algorithms work, in terms of how they train and predict.

- What's the procedure behind the scenes?
- What's the theory behind it?

This discussion doesn't have to be mathematically rigorous, unless that suits you better.

As an example, if you were describing the SVM, you might discuss such concepts as "maximizing the margin" and the "kernel trick‚Äù.

The purpose of taking this theoretical perspective is that it helps your reader to understand how it's treating the data, and therefore gives more objective reasoning for why it may be optimal in this situation.

<br>

*Algorithms and techniques used in the project are thoroughly discussed and properly justified based on the characteristics of the problem.*

All great visuals to show here!

These are important data qualities and certainly things well worth visualizing; good use of this section.

Also, good discussion!

<br>

*Student clearly defines a benchmark result or threshold for comparing performances of solutions obtained.*

Comparing to well defined, objective, concrete model/result is always the best approach for obtaining a baseline for our own work, and that's what you have here. Good choice.

<br>

### Methodology 

*The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary.*

Good exploration of the problem!

<br>

*All preprocessing steps have been clearly documented. Abnormalities or characteristics of the data or input that needed to be addressed have been corrected. If no data preprocessing is necessary, it has been clearly justified.*

This is a solid and detailed step by step overview of the work required to prepare your data for proper training, and it's written in a way that's clear and detailed. Great!

<br>

*The process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data has been thoroughly documented. Complications that occurred during the coding process are discussed.*

Very solid step by step process here, as it is quite clear how you approached this problem.

<br>

### Results 

*The final results are compared to the benchmark result or threshold with some type of statistical analysis. Justification is made as to whether the final model and solution is significant enough to have adequately solved the problem.*

Good comparison with the benchmark and great results here! Congrats!!! üëèüëèüëèüëè

<br>

*The final model‚Äôs qualities‚Äîsuch as parameters‚Äîare evaluated in detail. Some type of analysis is used to validate the robustness of the model‚Äôs solution.*

Your final results are presented in a way that's easy to analyze and compare.

You have a good analysis of your final model and excellent analysis to validate the robustness of the model‚Äôs solution.
