### Proposal

[Project proposal template from Udacity](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/blob/master/Capstone%20Project/capstone_proposal_template.md)

| CRITERIA            | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain Background   | Student briefly details background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited. A discussion of the student's personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required. |
| Problem Statement   | Student clearly describes the problem that is to be solved. The problem is well defined and has at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, the problem is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable. |
| Datasets and Inputs | The dataset(s) and/or input(s) to be used in the project are thoroughly described. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included. It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem. |
| Solution Statement  | Student clearly describes a solution to the problem. The solution is applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, the solution is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable. |
| Benchmark Model     | A benchmark model is provided that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the student's benchmark model provides context for existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which can then be objectively compared to the student's solution. The benchmark model is clearly defined and measurable. |
| Evaluation Metrics  | Student proposes at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model presented. The evaluation metric(s) proposed are appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. |
| Project Design      | Student summarizes a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Discussion is made as to what strategies may be employed, what analysis of the data might be required, or which algorithms will be considered. The workflow and discussion provided align with the qualities of the project. Small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams are encouraged but not required. |
| Presentation        | Proposal follows a well-organized structure and would be readily understood by its intended audience. Each section is written in a clear, concise and specific manner. Few grammatical and spelling mistakes are present. All resources used and referenced are properly cited. |

### Project

**Definition**

| CRITERIA          | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Overview  | Student provides a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is given. |
| Problem Statement | The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made. |
| Metrics           | Metrics used to measure the performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem. |

**Analysis**

| CRITERIA                  | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Exploration          | If a dataset is present, features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed, along with a sampling of the data. In lieu of a dataset, a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics of the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified. |
| Exploratory Visualization | A visualization has been provided that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data with thorough discussion. Visual cues are clearly defined. |
| Algorithms and Techniques | Algorithms and techniques used in the project are thoroughly discussed and properly justified based on the characteristics of the problem. |
| Benchmark                 | Student clearly defines a benchmark result or threshold for comparing performances of solutions obtained. |

**Methodology**

| CRITERIA           | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Preprocessing | All preprocessing steps have been clearly documented. Abnormalities or characteristics of the data or input that needed to be addressed have been corrected. If no data preprocessing is necessary, it has been clearly justified. |
| Implementation     | The process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data has been thoroughly documented. Complications that occurred during the coding process are discussed. |
| Refinement         | The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary. |

**Results**

| CRITERIA                        | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model Evaluation and Validation | The final model’s qualities—such as parameters—are evaluated in detail. Some type of analysis is used to validate the robustness of the model’s solution. |
| Justification                   | The final results are compared to the benchmark result or threshold with some type of statistical analysis. Justification is made as to whether the final model and solution is significant enough to have adequately solved the problem. |
