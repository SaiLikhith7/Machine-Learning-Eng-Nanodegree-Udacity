**Objectives:** Build predictive models using a variety of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. Understand cloud deployment terminology and best practices. Use Amazon SageMaker to deploy machine learning models to production environments, such a as web application or piece of hardware. A/B test two different deployed models and evaluate their performance. Utilize an API to deploy a model to a website such that it responds to user input, dynamically. Update a deployed model, in response to changes in the underlying data source.
