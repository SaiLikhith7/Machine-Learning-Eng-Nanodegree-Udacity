# Deployment Project: Sentiment Analysis

## Using PyTorch and SageMaker

<br>

## Project

In this project we will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. A model is created using Amazon's SageMaker service and deployed using a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

<br>

## Submission

- The `SageMaker Project.ipynb` file and an HTML project notebook with the name `report.html`
- The completed `train/train.py` and `serve/predict.py` python files.
- The edited `website/index.html` file. (Note: the api url is removed in the version you find on GitHub)
