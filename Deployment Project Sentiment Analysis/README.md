# Deployment Project: Sentiment Analysis

## Using PyTorch and SageMaker

<br>

## Project

In this project we will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. A model is created using Amazon's SageMaker service and deployed using a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
